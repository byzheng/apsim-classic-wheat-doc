"],["scope.html", "2 Scope of the APSIM-Wheat module", " 2 Scope of the APSIM-Wheat module The APSIM-Wheat module simulates the wheat growth and development of a wheat crop in a daily time-step on an area basis (per square meter, not per single plant). In this module, the wheat crop Wheat growth and development responds to weather (radiation, temperature), soil water and soil nitrogen, and management practices. The wheat module returns information on its soil water and nitrogen uptake to the soil water and nitrogen modules on a daily basis for reset of these systems. Information on crop cover is also provided to the water balance module for calculation of evaporation rates and runoff. Wheat stover and root residues are ‘passed’ from wheat to the surface residue and soil nitrogen modules, respectively at the harvest of the wheat crop. The approaches used in modeling crop processes balance the need for a comprehensive description of the observed variation in crop performance over diverse production environments and the need to avoid reductionist approaches of ever-greater complexity with large numbers of parameters that are difficult to measure. A list of the module outputs is provided in the Wheat module output s section below. Basically the module simulates phenological development, leaf area growth expansion, biomass and N concentration of different crop components (Leaf, Stem, Root and Grain) on a daily basis. It also predicts grain size and grain number. "],["history.html", "3 APSIM-Wheat history", " 3 APSIM-Wheat history APSIM-Wheat has been developed from a combination of the approaches used in previous APSIM wheat modules: Asseng, Keating, et al. (1998); Asseng, Fillery, et al. (1998); Keating et al. (2003); Meinke et al. (1997); Meinke et al. (1998). The current version of the model is implemented within the APSIM Plant model framework which is currently used for other crops such as grain legumes and canola. Most of the model constants (species-specific) and parameters (cultivar specific) are externalized from the code (wheat.xml file). Reference "],["reference.html", "4 Reference", " 4 Reference "]]
